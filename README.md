This project is a web application that stores information for multiple tasks, departments, and employees in an organization. The information can be viewed, added to, edited, and deleted, and there are relationships that link what departments that each employee works for as well as the tasks that are assigned to them.

There is a dashboard that displays the overview of all of this information for the users to view. Users can search for a specific task, department and employee. There is also a calendar that displays the tasks for the users to view.

Access the web application at http://i420882.hera.fhict.nl/
